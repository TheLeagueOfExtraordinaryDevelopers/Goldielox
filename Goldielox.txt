Goldielox is a Golden Music Player

Built for the web, and to allow sharing between neighbors.

Find your friends, and share your music. You purchased it, you might as well be
able to share it.

Goldielox does this without breaking any laws, by allowing you to transfer the
file to a friend, rather than making a copy.

You have the ability to retain a backup, and set a time period in which the
borrowed file should be returned.

If many share their music in this way, there will be much for everyone.

Goldielox doesn't rob Artist, as someone has to purchase the tracks and albums
for them to be shared in good faith. We encourage the honor system, with each
person being responsible for their own library, and what they share. In the
future, we hope that artists will be supported directly, and their music shared
openly. Music shouldn't be sold, nor should it be silenced.

The more copies which are owned, the richer the network. And since lenders are
simply lending their copies, their is no risk of loss.

I hope you find Goldielox an inspiring project, and perhaps even wish to
contribute in some way.

May it bring you hours of listening bliss!
